🚀 Features

🎶 Audio File Support - Upload any audio file (MP3, WAV) and bring the cosmos to life
⭐ Dynamic Star System - 200+ stars that pulse, glow, and form constellations based on your music
🎵 Real-time Audio Analysis - Responds to both frequency spectrum (FFT) and amplitude for natural motion
🎨 Constellation Networks - Stars connect and disconnect based on audio intensity
🖱️ Simple Interface - Intuitive workflow: Upload → Play → Watch the magic
⏯️ Playback Controls - Pause anytime or upload new tracks for fresh visualizations

🎨 How It Works

Upload your audio file using the file picker
Click "Awaken the Cosmos" to start playback
Watch as stars respond to your music:

FFT Analysis determines which stars react to specific frequencies
Amplitude Detection adds a global "breathing" effect that matches the beat


Pause or switch tracks to explore new visual patterns

javascript// Core audio analysis
fft = new p5.FFT(0.9, 128);           // Frequency analysis with 128 bins
amplitude = new p5.Amplitude();       // Overall volume level

// Real-time visualization updates
let spectrum = fft.analyze();         // Get frequency data
let level = amplitude.getLevel();     // Get amplitude level
star.update(level, spectrum);         // Update star based on audio

🧩 Technical Challenges & Solutions
1. 🔊 Audio Playback Reliability
Challenge: Modern browsers block autoplay to prevent unwanted audio
Solution: Implemented userStartAudio() to properly unlock audio context on user interaction
javascriptfunction ensureAudioUnlocked(callback) {
  userStartAudio().then(() => {
    audioUnlocked = true;
    callback();
  }).catch(() => {
    getAudioContext().resume();
    callback();
  });
}
2. 🎵 Creating Musical Motion
Challenge: Raw FFT data can be noisy and feel disconnected from the music
Solution: Blended per-frequency reactions with global amplitude for smooth, natural movement
javascript// Frequency-specific reactions
let freqIndex = floor(map(star.x, 0, width, 0, spectrum.length - 1));
let freq = spectrum[freqIndex] / 255;

// Global amplitude influence  
star.brightness = 100 + freq * 155 + audioLevel * 100;
💡 Key Learnings

FFT vs. Amplitude: FFT drives local star behavior; amplitude provides global pulse effects
Parameter Tuning: Small adjustments to star count, connection distance, and smoothing dramatically impact aesthetics and performance
UX Design: Clear UI states (Upload → Play/Pause) prevent user confusion and ensure smooth interactions
