# Cosmic-Music-Visualizer
🎵 Cosmic Music Visualizer is an interactive web app that transforms your music into a mesmerizing starry night sky. As your songs play, stars shimmer, glow, and connect into constellations that move with the rhythm and beat of your audio.

## 🖌️ Why p5.js?

This project leverages **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)**, a JavaScript library designed to make coding interactive visuals simple and intuitive:  
- Simplifies working with HTML5 Canvas for dynamic graphics.  
- Built-in support for audio analysis via **p5.sound**.  
- Ideal for creative coding, prototyping, and real-time interactive applications.  
- Encourages experimentation with visual and audio feedback.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎶 **Audio File Support** – Upload any audio file (MP3, WAV).  
- ⭐ **Dynamic Star System** – 200+ stars that pulse, glow, and form constellations.  
- 🎵 **Real-time Audio Analysis** – Uses FFT and amplitude for natural motion.  
- 🎨 **Constellation Networks** – Stars connect/disconnect based on audio intensity.  
- 🖱️ **Simple Interface** – Upload → Play → Watch the magic.  
- ⏯️ **Playback Controls** – Pause or switch tracks anytime.

## 🎨 How It Works

1. Upload an audio file using the file picker.  
2. Click **"Awaken the Cosmos"** to start playback.  
3. Watch as stars respond to your music:  
   - **FFT Analysis** → Determines which stars react to specific frequencies.  
   - **Amplitude Detection** → Adds a global "breathing" effect matching the beat.  
4. Pause or switch tracks for new visual patterns.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology      | Purpose                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| p5.js           | Canvas rendering, DOM manipulation, interactive sketches |
| p5.sound        | Audio playback, FFT analysis, amplitude detection |
| HTML5 Canvas    | Real-time graphics rendering                     |
| Web Audio API   | Low-level audio processing and analysis         |

## 💡 Key Learnings

- FFT drives local star behavior; amplitude provides global pulse effects.
- Tuning star count, connection distance, and smoothing improves aesthetics.
- Clear UI states (Upload → Play/Pause) improve user experience.
